# Spotify_Clone
Hello! This is a project I created for my senior project in University. As the name states, this is a spotify clone made from scratch using XAMPP. XAMMP is a completely free, easy to install Apache disctribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. You can download and install it yourself if you'd like to recreate this repo -> https://www.apachefriends.org/

The main skills used to achieve the completion of this project were Javascript, PHP, HTML, and MySQL. Working on this project took me through the entire development process; from planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing & integration and maintenance.
